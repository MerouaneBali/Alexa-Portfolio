# Alexa's Portfolio

A simple static website. [Live Demo](https://alexa-web-portfolio.netlify.app/).

## Details

[Alexa's portfolio](https://alexa-web-portfolio.netlify.app/) is a simple **single page** website built with HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, GSAP.

Animated initally with CSS3 Keyframes, but reconstucted to animate with **GSAP** for a better control of the transitions.

Created that helped me get back on the web track after working on a **React Native** project for 6+ Months.
